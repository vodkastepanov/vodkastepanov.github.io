                    Hello to anyone reading this. This is my first blog entry. I wanted to start this 
                    blog to document my progress in learning to code. I'm still not sure, whether to choose
                    Python or JavaScript, leaning towards Python though, because it seems easier and is
                    more popular.
                    However, I want to start studying Economy Informatics in Berlin this autumn, and there they
                    will first teach us JavaScript, so maybe I would better prepare for that.

                    I have already acquired some knowledge in VBA in a Minijob, where my task was to get numbers
                    in an Excel sheet sorted and then transferred to an official letter, reporting about how much many was made 
                    by the firm I was working at.

                    That was so much fun that I decided to go into this direction, I just have to decide which language 
                    to learn first...
