                    Hello to anyone reading this. This is my first blog entry. I wanted to start this 
                    blog to document my progress in learning to code. I'm still not sure, whether to choose
                    Python or JavaScript, leaning towards Python though, because it seems easier and is
                    more popular.
                    However, I want to start studying Economy Informatics in Berlin this autumn, and there they
                    will first teach us JavaScript, so maybe I would better prepare for that.

                    I have already acquired some knowledge in VBA in a Minijob, where my task was to get numbers
                    in an Excel sheet sorted and then transferred to an official letter, reporting about how much many was made 
                    by the firm I was working at.

                    That was so much fun that I decided to go into this direction, I just have to decide which language 
                    to learn first...

                    <time datetime="25.06.2022">JUN 25, 2022</time>
                    <p>
                        So I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjcY_00U1w">this video</a> on YouTube of this guy
                        automating the Reddit TTS videos on YouTube shorts. That sounded pretty cool, and his aim, as he also
                        mentions in his video, is to make coding more interesting for people, to give them something practical,
                        so that coding does not seem so abstract. 
                        <p>

                        What I personally also really like is the fact, that the whole point of the project is automation, which is 
                        something I have been working on in my Side-/Mini-job with VBA. <br> 
                    
                        My goal is to understand this piece of code, but now I have multiple ways of approaching this:
                        <p>
                        1. I can look for something like a course: "Learn Python in 30 Days" or smth like that. That way I will have steady progress.
                        <p>
                        2. I can try to realize smaller projects first: for example first build smth like "Rock, Paper, Scissors", then 
                           proceed to something more difficult like Tetris, and so on and so on.
                        <p>    
                        3. I just download the code of the VideoBot and try to understand it step by step.
                        <p>

                        The problem with 1. is, that I feel like those courses are going to be somewhat generic and also boring. Not really practical.
                        See, this is my problem with the whole topic of coding etc.: 90% of the time I don't really know what to do with it.
                        <p>
                        So 2. seems better, right? I mean, it is something really practical: I get to code minigames. But on the other hand 
                        that is just as generic as Number 1. Why would I build Tetris? I mean, yeah it's interesting and funny and so on, but it's
                        still nothing more than some generic games nothing that <em>really</em> matters.
                        <p>
                        So I guess there is only 3. left! That is actually also the way I learned to code VBA: I just had to look at and understand
                        code, that was written by someone else. So what I will do is <a href="https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot">download the VideoBot Code from GitHub</a>
                        and then try to understand it. I will have to break it down into the smallest questions and topics, which Í will document here,
                        and in the end I hope I will understand it. <br>
                        <strong>Learning by doing</strong>, right?
